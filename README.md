# Dumb-Compiler
I have no training in compiler design. How well can I do?

This project is just for fun. At my school, there is a compilers class, and I'm going to be home over the summer, so I'm 
gonna try implementing a compiler before and after I complete the class, and we'll see how much I've grown.
